Depending on your career background, you often develop an intuition for recognizing which companies have real potentialâ€”especially in the stock market. For example, as a software engineer, I'm naturally more familiar with the tech industry, so I can usually tell which tech companies are strong and which ones are likely to struggle. That kind of insight builds over time, but once you have it, it sticks with you.

Intuition isn't exclusive to a particular career background, you can be self-taught and still have a strong intuition.

**Rule of thumb: stay away from biotech companies, automotive companies, and any company with 'Therapeutics' in its name, regardless of your experience in the field.**
