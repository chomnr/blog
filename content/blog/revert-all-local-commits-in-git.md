Sometimes you need to discard all your local commits and reset your branch to match the remote repository. Here are the most common methods to achieve this.

### Method 1: Reset to Remote Branch (Recommended)

This will discard all local commits and reset your branch to match the remote:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Replace `main` with your branch name (e.g., `master`, `develop`, etc.).

### Method 2: Fetch Latest and Reset

If you want to ensure you have the latest remote changes first:

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Method 3: Reset to Specific Remote Branch

If you're working on a different branch:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/your-branch-name
```

### Method 4: Soft Reset (Keeps Changes as Unstaged)

If you want to keep your changes but remove the commits:

```bash
git reset --soft origin/main
```

### Method 5: Mixed Reset (Default)

Removes commits but keeps changes as unstaged:

```bash
git reset origin/main
```
