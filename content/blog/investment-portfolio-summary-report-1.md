## Market Conditions on May 21, 2025

On May 21, 2025, U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn, influenced by several key factors:

- **Rising Treasury Yields:**  
  The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond surpassed 5%, its highest level since October 2023. This increase was attributed to a weak 20-year bond auction and concerns over the federal government's growing debt, leading to higher borrowing costs and investor apprehension.
- **Government Debt Concerns:**  
  Investor anxiety intensified following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt from Aaa to Aa1, coupled with legislative proposals to extend tax cuts, potentially escalating fiscal strain.

- **Retail Sector Weakness:**  
  Retailers like Target reported disappointing earnings and lowered their full-year sales forecasts, citing the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. This contributed to broader market declines.

- **Market Index Performance:**  
  The S&P 500 fell by 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.4%, reflecting widespread investor concerns.
