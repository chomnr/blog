builder, click Edit expression to switch to the advanced editor.\nConfiguring the rule:\nPaste this expression into the editor:\n\nThis rule checks both the origin and referer headers for domains using these extensions, which are often associated with spam and malicious activity.\nFinalizing the rule:\nUnder Choose action, select Block.\nUnder Select order, select First. So it runs before other rules that might allow the traffic through.\nClick Deploy to activate the rule.\nWhat this blocks:\nThe rule targets traffic from domains using extensions like .xyz, .top, .tk, and others that are frequently used for spam, phishing, and bot traffic. It checks both the origin header (where the request claims to come from) and the referer header (the page that linked to your site).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/block-certain-tlds-in-cloudflare/","title":"how to block certain tlds in cloudflare"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cloud-vs-bare-metal-cost/":{"body":"The biggest difference between cloud and bare-metal is scalability.

If you don't have Docker installed yet, follow the installation guide at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.\nCreating your Zero Trust tunnel:\nIf you're new to Cloudflare and Docker, Zero Trust essentially creates a secure tunnel between your containers and Cloudflare's network without exposing ports directly to the internet.\nNavigate to https://dash.cloudflare.com/ (or go directly to https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and click on Zero Trust. Go to Networks → Tunnels and click Add a tunnel.\nFollow the setup instructions, making sure to select Cloudflared instead of WARP Connector. When you reach the Install and run connectors step, select Docker as your environment.\nBefore running the connector command that Cloudflare provides, create a Docker network first:\n\nNow modify the Docker command from Cloudflare by adding the --network tutorial parameter. Your command should look like this:\n\nRun this command and your tunnel should connect successfully. Once connected, click on your tunnel name, select Edit, and go to Public Hostname. Choose your desired domain and path, set the type to HTTP, and for the URL use your Docker container's IP address with the appropriate port.\nImportant: Make sure any containers you want to route through the tunnel are on the same Docker network (tutorial in this example) as your tunnel container.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cloudflare-zero-trust-docker-setup/","title":"how to setup cloudflare zero trust using docker"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/connect-docker-containers-to-nginx/":{"body":"This guide shows you how to connect your Docker containers to NGINX for reverse proxying and load balancing.\nWhat you'll need:\n\nServer (optional)\nDocker installed\nNGINX\n\nGetting started:\nYou can set up NGINX with or without Docker, but this example uses Docker. If you need to install NGINX, check the official guide at https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html. For Docker installation, follow the documentation at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.\nIf you're running NGINX in Docker, you'll need to mount your nginx.conf file from your server. If you're unfamiliar with mounting files in Docker, this guide explains it well: https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-mount-single-file-in-volume.\nSetting up the network:\nThe key to connecting containers to NGINX is using a shared Docker network. Create a network that both NGINX and your application containers will use:\n\nWhen running your containers, add the network flag to ensure they can communicate:\n\nVerify that your containers are on the same network by inspecting it:\n\nConfiguring NGINX:\nAdd this server block to your nginx.conf to proxy requests to your Docker container:\n\nReplace container_name with your actual container name and container_port with the port your application is listening on inside the container.\nTroubleshooting:\nIf the connection isn't working, check that both containers are on the same network and that your application container has the correct port exposed. DNS resolution using container names only works on custom networks - if you're running NGINX directly on the host machine instead of in a container, you might need to use the container's IP address instead of its name.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/connect-docker-containers-to-nginx/","title":"how to connect docker container to nginx"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/install-docker-on-linux-mint/":{"body":"This guide explains how to install Docker on Linux Mint/Ubuntu.\nInstall Required Packages\nFirst, update your package index and install the necessary packages:\n\nAdd Docker's Official GPG Key\nCreate the keyrings directory and add Docker's GPG key:\n\nAdd the Docker Repository\nAdd Docker's repository with the correct Ubuntu code name:\n\nUpdate Package Index\nUpdate the package index to include Docker packages:\n\nInstall Docker\nFinally, install Docker and its components:\n\nVerify Installation\nTo verify that Docker is installed correctly, run:\n\nOptional: Add User to Docker Group\nTo run Docker commands without sudo, add your user to the docker group:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/install-docker-on-linux-mint/","title":"how to install docker on linux mint"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intuition-against-stocks/":{"body":"Depending on your career background or personal interests, you often develop an intuition for recognizing which companies have real potential especially in the stock market.

Initially developed as a closed-source component for a side project, I've since decided to release it to the public.\nBelow, I'll walk through my thought process and reasoning behind key design decisions during the development of this project. For each component, I'll detail the advantages, disadvantages, and potential alternative approaches.\nTask System:\nThe Task System was designed to delegate database operations (it's pretty much just an actor). Rather than repeatedly reinstantiating database connections to update fields, we can queue desired tasks through a specialized system. This approach improves function clarity and execution efficiency.\n\nConsider the difference between traditional database operations and the Task System approach:\nTraditional approach:\n\nTask System approach:\n\nInstead of direct instantiation through a CRUD function, the Task System handles the instantiation when it receives the task.\nTo successfully compose and send a task to the Task System, you need three components: TaskType identifies which handler to use, TaskHandler&lt;D&gt; assigns a specific \"action\" to Task&lt;D, R, P&gt; where D is Database, and Task&lt;D, R, P&gt; performs the actual task where D is Database, R is TaskRequest, and P is The Type.\nOnce these components are defined, you must register the TaskType with the corresponding listener. You can see how to register a listener here.\nWith registration complete, you can create a function that sends requests to the task channel:\n\nTaskRequest composes a request that the Task System can interpret. Then, calling TaskManager::process_task(task_request) will return either a Completed or Failed status. If you expect a custom return type, you can use TaskManager::process_task_with_result::&lt;T&gt;(request) instead.\nThe Task System uses a bidirectional channel flow. When the system receives a request, it first routes to the INBOUND channel, then sends results to the OUTBOUND channel. This bidirectional setup allows reliable result retrieval.\nAdvantages include function simplicity and granular control. Disadvantages include major overhead and no support for nested tasks. Alternative approaches could use a message broker instead of channels, implement Redis pub/sub instead of channels, add tasks to a hashmap first then have the task system pull directly from the hashmap (though this would require multiple hashmaps for each type, adding overhead), or use serialization to reduce reliance on generic types.\nCache System:\nThe Cache System follows a similar pattern to the Task System but uses Redis instead of PostgreSQL. I separated these systems because of a limitation: you cannot call a task within another task (or a channel within a channel) unless it comes from a different instance. The Cache System uses a separate channel instance, allowing cache operations to be called from within tasks.\nIAM (Identity And Access Management):\nThe IAM implementation in this project is relatively straightforward. It doesn't include more advanced features like effects, resources, or policies, focusing instead on user roles and permissions.\nPermission System:\nI designed the permission system for flexibility. Permissions are stored in PostgreSQL but cached differently than other data. Rather than using the Cache System to store them in Redis, they're cached locally in a HashMap. This approach was chosen based on scale considerations: while you might expect hundreds of permissions, you could have hundreds of thousands of users.\nThe permission caching mechanism is straightforward but distinct from the main Cache System. If you want to use a local cache, you can bypass the Cache System and use LocalizedCache&lt;T&gt;, where T represents the type you want to cache (e.g., Permission). You would then implement LocalizedCache&lt;Permission&gt; for your PermissionCache type.\nWhen calling fn add(item: T), the system adds three keys: permission_id, permission_name, and permission_key. I chose to add these three keys because each field is unique in the database, allowing permissions to be retrieved by ID, name, or key.\nAll key values use an Arc&lt;T&gt; (where T is the same as in LocalizedCache&lt;T&gt;), creating a shared state. This means when you implement an fn update() and modify a field, it automatically updates the other two references.\nThe schema includes permission_id (UUID of the permission randomly generated using the uuid crate), permission_name (Name of the permission like \"Ban User\"), and permission_key (Key of the permission like \"admin.ban.user\"). The permission_name and permission_key can follow any format, though the examples above represent the ideal structure.\nRoles and permissions are interconnected. To maintain consistency, the role type includes a field pub role_permissions: Vec&lt;String&gt;, which contains only the IDs of associated permissions. This approach was chosen because the permission ID is the only immutable field within a permission.\nRole System:\nI think of roles as collections of grouped permissions. This allows for predefined permission sets that can be assigned to specific roles, eliminating the need to assign individual permissions (like \"ban\") to each user. Instead, users can be assigned a role with pre-configured permissions, ensuring consistency across the application.\nThe schema includes role_id (UUID of the role randomly generated using the uuid crate) and role_name (Name of the role like \"Moderator\"). The role_name and role_id can follow any format, though the examples represent the ideal naming convention.\nUser Management:\nExamining the schema.sql file and the iam_users table, you'll notice the absence of password fields. This is by design, as users authenticate exclusively through OAuth2 providers such as Google and Discord.\nThe iam_users table includes security_token and security_stamp fields, inspired by ASP.NET Core's security model. When the security_stamp changes, the security_token is automatically invalidated.\nThe security_stamp doesn't have a specific model but uses the String type. To generate a valid stamp, the function fn generate_security_stamp(security_stamp: String, action: &amp;str) is used. This function captures the current time in milliseconds, hashes it with SHA-256, and converts it to a hexadecimal string.\nThe model for security_token is:\n\nThe token generation process calls SecurityToken::new(security_stamp: String, action: &amp;str), serializes the model with serde_json and converts to hexadecimal, then stores the hexadecimal representation in the database.\nTo retrieve the token, call decode_then_deserialize(security_token: Option&lt;String&gt;), which decodes the hexadecimal string, deserializes it to the SecurityToken type, and returns None if the token is empty.\nTo generate a token with a specific action, use UserSecurity::create(action). For example, to create an email reset token:\n\nThen, in your route handler for /auth/email_reset, check if the SecurityToken exists and verify that the action is set to \"email_reset\". If not, deny access.\nThis completes the technical overview of the current state of the Ark project. I welcome feedback and contributions to further improve its architecture and functionality.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-ark/","title":"technical breakdown: ark"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-brute/":{"body":"A complete rewrite of my previous security monitoring tool, addressing major design flaws and performance issues.

Required manual updates and because of that the data would get stale quick.\nJSON as Database\nWriting worked fine, but reading became problematic as file size grew. This impacted reliability regardless of server specs.\nOvercomplicated Data Structure\nTracked password usage, usernames, metrics (hourly, daily, weekly), country data, and combinations through ObjectMapper. Created unnecessary complexity and maintenance headaches.\nInefficient Log Processing\nThe workflow was wasteful:\n\nWait for OpenSSH to dump credentials to text file\nRead file contents\nParse individual entries\nParse entire log\nStore in JSON file\n\nRequired regular maintenance to prevent log files from growing too large. The only good part was the WebSocket implementation for real-time updates.\nHow Brute Fixes Everything\nRebuilt from scratch in Rust for better memory safety, reliability, and performance.\nPostgreSQL Database\nProfessional database implementation enables better data management, improved queries, and multi-server data collection.\nHTTP API Architecture\nInstead of monitoring text files, Brute runs an HTTP server with /brute/attack/add endpoint protected by bearer token authentication. Processes data immediately and broadcasts updates via WebSocket.\nReliable IPInfo API\nDirect API integration eliminates missing IP issues and removes manual database updates.\nActor-Based Design\nClean architecture with specific handlers for each task, improving code organization and maintainability.\nTechnical Implementation\nCore dependencies handle web framework, database, and geolocation:\n\nInitially used Axum but switched to Actix-web. The actor system implementation solved the original post-request handling issues.\nThe /brute/attack/add endpoint processes incoming attack data:\n\nThe workflow is straightforward:\n\nVerify authentication via bearer token\nValidate IP address (no local addresses)\nPerform data validation (string length, IP range verification)\nProcess through actor system\nBroadcast results to WebSocket clients\n\nThe BruteSystem actor handles operations through dedicated handlers:\n\nThe reporter.start_report() method initiates database transactions for storing and processing attack data.\nDatabase interactions use a standardized Reportable trait:\n\nImplementation for the Individual model:\n\nThis creates database entries with clean, maintainable patterns.\nTo minimize IPInfo API usage, a caching system stores IP data:\n\nCheck if IP exists in cache\nIf found and less than 5 minutes old, use cached data\nIf not found or stale, fetch from API\nStore results in cache\n\nThis reduces API requests while maintaining data accuracy.\nThe rewrite is significantly better than the original.

If successful, it skips the next 2 lines. If authentication fails, it hits our module and then the denial module.\nWhat I'd Do Differently\nSeveral design decisions proved suboptimal:\nSkip the modular analytics system for a simpler hardcoded approach. The current complexity isn't justified for a project that requires an OpenSSH vulnerability to function.\nUse C for the entire project rather than mixing Java and C. Using two languages introduces unnecessary complexity when C would handle everything more efficiently.\nUse the IPInfo API instead of .mmdb files to avoid manual database updates and maintenance overhead.\nReplace JSON with SQLite for better data handling.

This project represents a complete redesign of my previous work, featuring an authentication system and web-based architecture. I've maintained the use of AES symmetric encryption from my previous solution as it remains ideal for securely storing credentials.\nFrom Desktop to Web:\nMy original credential manager was built as a terminal application in C# with .NET 7. While functional and cross-platform, it required executing an .exe file and had limited portability compared to web-based solutions. The core functionality was straightforward: users would create an AES key and credential store, then upload both to modify their stored credentials.\nThe new implementation uses a completely different technology stack with Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend, Next.js API routes for the backend, MongoDB with Prisma ORM for data storage, and AES encryption with iron-session for authentication. This technology selection was deliberate, creating a more accessible and maintainable solution while preserving strong security principles.\nDatabase Architecture:\nRather than storing credentials in files, I chose MongoDB as a NoSQL database solution. This decision was driven by the need for flexibility rather than rigid structure—perfect for a credential manager where different credential types might require different data fields.\nHere's the Prisma schema defining the data models:\n\nEach vault contains a unique identifier, name and capacity limit, encrypted validation string (the \"secret\"), initialization vector (IV) for encryption, and relationship to multiple credentials. The encryption strategy is selective—only the data field in the Credential model is encrypted. This approach maintains security for sensitive information while keeping metadata like credential type, name, and timestamps accessible for filtering and organization without requiring decryption.\nThe secret and iv fields in the Vault model serve a validation purpose. Rather than storing the actual encryption key, I encrypt a known string (\"secret\") and store the result. When a user provides their key, the system attempts to decrypt this validation string—if successful, the key is proven valid.\nAuthentication System:\nThe application follows a \"one user, multiple vaults\" design philosophy. I intentionally hardcoded credentials in environment variables to prevent multiple user accounts, encouraging shared access with separate vaults for different purposes or users.\nSession management is handled through the iron-session library, which provides secure cookie-based authentication:\n\nThis implementation retrieves the encrypted cookie from the request, verifies the session's validity and expiration, and works alongside middleware to protect authenticated routes. This approach provides a defense-in-depth strategy—even if the authentication is compromised, attackers still need the correct AES key to access any vault data.\nEncryption Implementation:\nI maintained AES as the encryption algorithm, using AES-CBC with 256-bit keys for industry-standard security:\n\nWhen a user creates a vault, the system generates a cryptographically secure 256-bit key, encrypts a known validation string (\"secret\") with this key, stores the encrypted validation string and IV in the database, returns the actual encryption key to the user for safekeeping, and requires this key for future access to the vault. This approach ensures the encryption key never remains on the server, maintaining a zero-knowledge security model.\nKey Improvements:\nThis credential manager represents a major improvement over its predecessor, transitioning from a terminal-based application to a modern web solution while preserving strong security principles. The web-based interface is accessible from any modern browser, the NoSQL database accommodates various credential types, improved security maintains strong encryption while adding an authentication layer, the user experience is more intuitive than the terminal application, and selective encryption only encrypts sensitive data, improving performance and usability.\nThe \"one user, multiple vaults\" approach provides flexibility while maintaining simplicity in the authentication system. Each vault requires its own encryption key, ensuring compartmentalized security even when multiple users share the same login. While there are still opportunities for improvement (such as refining the session expiration mechanism), the current implementation successfully balances security, usability, and modern web architecture.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-vault/","title":"technical breakdown: vault"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/block-certain-tlds-in-cloudflare/":{"body":114,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cloud-vs-bare-metal-cost/":{"body":56,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cloudflare-zero-trust-docker-setup/":{"body":160,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/connect-docker-containers-to-nginx/":{"body":150,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/install-docker-on-linux-mint/":{"body":74,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intuition-against-stocks/":{"body":51,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/investment-income/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ssh-into-a-running-container/":{"body":14,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-ark/":{"body":658,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-brute/":{"body":343,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-bruteexpose/":{"body":275,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-vault/":{"body":439,"title":3}},"length":14},"lang":"English"}
