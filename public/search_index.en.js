Initially developed as a closed-source component for a side project, I've since decided to release it to the public.\nTechnical Breakdown\nBelow, I'll walk through my thought process and reasoning behind key design decisions during the development of this project. For each component, I'll detail the advantages, disadvantages, and potential alternative approaches.\nTask System\nThe Task System was designed to delegate database operations (it's pretty much just an actor). Rather than repeatedly reinstantiating database connections to update fields, we can queue desired tasks through a specialized system. This approach significantly improves function clarity and execution efficiency.\n\nConsider the difference between traditional database operations and the Task System approach:\nTraditional approach:\n\nTask System approach:\n\nInstead of direct instantiation through a CRUD function, the Task System handles the instantiation when it receives the task.\nTask System Components\nTo successfully compose and send a task to the Task System, you need three essential components:\n\nTaskType - Identifies which handler to use\nTaskHandler&lt;D&gt; - Assigns a specific \"action\" to Task&lt;D, R, P&gt;\n\nD: Database\n\n\nTask&lt;D, R, P&gt; - Performs the actual task\n\nD: Database\nR: TaskRequest\nP: The Type\n\n\n\nOnce these components are defined, you must register the TaskType with the corresponding listener. You can see how to register a listener here.\nWith registration complete, you can create a function that sends requests to the task channel:\n\nTaskRequest composes a request that the Task System can interpret. Then, calling TaskManager::process_task(task_request) will return either a Completed or Failed status. If you expect a custom return type, you can use TaskManager::process_task_with_result::&lt;T&gt;(request) instead.\nChanneling\nThe Task System uses a bidirectional channel flow. When the system receives a request, it first routes to the INBOUND channel, then sends results to the OUTBOUND channel. This bidirectional setup enables reliable result retrieval.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\nAdvantages:\n\nFunction simplicity\nGranular control\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nSignificant complexity overhead\nNo support for nested tasks\n\nAlternative Approaches:\n\nUse a message broker instead of channels\nImplement Redis pub/sub instead of channels\nAdd tasks to a hashmap first, then have the task system pull directly from the hashmap (though this would require multiple hashmaps for each type, adding complexity)\nUse serialization to reduce reliance on generic types\n\nCache System\nThe Cache System follows a similar pattern to the Task System but uses Redis instead of PostgreSQL. I separated these systems because of a limitation: you cannot call a task within another task (or a channel within a channel) unless it comes from a different instance. The Cache System uses a separate channel instance, allowing cache operations to be called from within tasks.\nIAM (Identity And Access Management)\nThe IAM implementation in this project is relatively straightforward. It doesn't include more complex features like effects, resources, or policies, focusing instead on user roles and permissions.\nPermission System\nI designed the permission system for flexibility. Permissions are stored in PostgreSQL but cached differently than other data. Rather than using the Cache System to store them in Redis, they're cached locally in a HashMap. This approach was chosen based on scale considerations: while you might expect hundreds of permissions, you could have hundreds of thousands of users.\nCaching\nThe permission caching mechanism is straightforward but distinct from the main Cache System. If you want to use a local cache, you can bypass the Cache System and use LocalizedCache&lt;T&gt;, where T represents the type you want to cache (e.g., Permission). You would then implement LocalizedCache&lt;Permission&gt; for your PermissionCache type.\nWhen calling fn add(item: T), the system adds three keys: permission_id, permission_name, and permission_key. I chose to add these three keys because each field is unique in the database, allowing permissions to be retrieved by ID, name, or key.\nAll key values use an Arc&lt;T&gt; (where T is the same as in LocalizedCache&lt;T&gt;), creating a shared state. This means when you implement an fn update() and modify a field, it automatically updates the other two references.\nSchema\n\npermission_id: UUID of the permission (randomly generated using the uuid crate)\npermission_name: Name of the permission. Example: \"Ban User\"\npermission_key: Key of the permission. Example: \"admin.ban.user\"\n\nThe permission_name and permission_key can follow any format, though the examples above represent the ideal structure.\nRelation\nRoles and permissions are interconnected. To maintain consistency, the role type includes a field pub role_permissions: Vec&lt;String&gt;, which contains only the IDs of associated permissions. This approach was chosen because the permission ID is the only immutable field within a permission.\nRole System\nI conceptualize roles as collections of grouped permissions. This allows for predefined permission sets that can be assigned to specific roles, eliminating the need to assign individual permissions (like \"ban\") to each user. Instead, users can be assigned a role with pre-configured permissions, ensuring consistency across the application.\nSchema\n\nrole_id: UUID of the role (randomly generated using the uuid crate)\nrole_name: Name of the role. Example: \"Moderator\"\n\nThe role_name and role_id can follow any format, though the examples represent the ideal naming convention.\nUser Management\nExamining the schema.sql file and the iam_users table, you'll notice the absence of password fields. This is by design, as users authenticate exclusively through OAuth2 providers such as Google and Discord.\nSecurity Features\nThe iam_users table includes security_token and security_stamp fields, inspired by ASP.NET Core's security model. When the security_stamp changes, the security_token is automatically invalidated. Let me break down how this currently works:\nsecurity_stamp\nThe security_stamp doesn't have a specific model but uses the String type. To generate a valid stamp, the function fn generate_security_stamp(security_stamp: String, action: &amp;str) is used. This function captures the current time in milliseconds, hashes it with SHA-256, and converts it to a hexadecimal string.\nsecurity_token\nThe model for security_token is:\n\nThe token generation process:\n\nCall SecurityToken::new(security_stamp: String, action: &amp;str)\nSerialize the model with serde_json and convert to hexadecimal\nStore the hexadecimal representation in the database\n\nTo retrieve the token, call decode_then_deserialize(security_token: Option&lt;String&gt;), which decodes the hexadecimal string, deserializes it to the SecurityToken type, and returns None if the token is empty.\nShorthand Usage\nTo generate a token with a specific action, use UserSecurity::create(action). For example, to create an email reset token:\n\nThen, in your route handler for /auth/email_reset, check if the SecurityToken exists and verify that the action is set to \"email_reset\". If not, deny access.\n\nThis completes the technical overview of the current state of the Ark project. I welcome feedback and contributions to further improve its architecture and functionality.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-ark/","title":"Technical Breakdown: Ark"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-brute/":{"body":"Introducing Brute: Monitors authentication attempts on your server\nI'm excited to announce the release of my latest project, Brute. This application represents a complete redevelopment of my previous attempt at a security monitoring tool, addressing numerous design flaws and performance issues.\nFor those unfamiliar with the project, I encourage you to check out the GitHub repository for full details and implementation.\nThe Predecessor: BruteExpose\nNow you might be wondering what was wrong with its predecessor BruteExpose, well, everything. Here's a list:\nKey Issues\n\n\nInefficient Geolocation Implementation\nI relied on IPinfo's MMDB (MaxMind Database) instead of their API, which caused errors when processing IP addresses not found in the database. The database required manual updates, creating maintenance overhead and reliability issues.\n\n\nPoor Data Storage Strategy\nUsing JSON as a database proved to be a significant mistake. While writing operations functioned adequately, reading operations became problematic once the file reached a certain size. This limitation seriously impacted reliability, regardless of server specifications.\n\n\nOverly Complex Data Structure\nThe JSON file structure—managed through an ObjectMapper—was highly organized but unnecessarily complex. It tracked password usage, usernames, various metrics (hourly, daily, weekly), country data, and username/password combinations. This approach cluttered the codebase and created maintenance challenges.\n\n\nInefficient Log Processing\nBruteExpose relied on monitoring a text file for SSH login attempts. The application would:\n\nWait for OpenSSH to dump credentials to a text file\nRead the file contents\nParse individual log entries\nParse the entire log\nStore results in the JSON file\n\nThis approach was inefficient and required regular maintenance to prevent the log file from growing too large.\n\n\nThe only positive aspect of BruteExpose was its WebSocket implementation, which allowed for real-time updates.\nThe Successor: Brute\nFor the redevelopment, I chose Rust instead of Java for its reliability, memory safety, and performance benefits. Here's how Brute improves upon its predecessor:\nMajor Improvements\n\n\nLanguage Choice\nRust provides superior memory safety and reliability compared to Java, making it ideal for a security-focused application.\n\n\nProfessional Database Implementation\nI replaced the JSON-based storage with PostgreSQL, enabling better data management, improved query capabilities, and the ability to collect data from multiple \"farmer\" servers.\n\n\nModern API Architecture\nInstead of monitoring text files for changes, Brute implements an HTTP server with dedicated endpoints (/brute/attack/add) protected by bearer token authentication. This approach processes data immediately and broadcasts updates to WebSocket clients in real-time.\n\n\nReliable Geolocation\nImplementing the IPInfo API eliminated issues with missing IP addresses and removed the need for manual database updates.\n\n\nActor-Based Architecture\nWithout the constraints of a JSON database, I adopted an actor-based design pattern, assigning specific handlers for each task to improve code organization and maintainability.\n\n\nTechnical Implementation\nCore Dependencies\n\nI initially used Axum as the web framework but switched to Actix-web due to specific issues. The transition didn't immediately resolve my problem, and the ultimate fix likely involved implementing the actor system to handle post-request mechanisms correctly.\nHTTP Endpoint Implementation\nThe /brute/attack/add endpoint processes incoming attack data:\n\nThe endpoint follows a clear workflow:\n\nVerify authentication via bearer token\nValidate IP address (no local addresses)\nPerform comprehensive validation (string length, IP range verification)\nProcess data through the actor system\nBroadcast results to WebSocket clients\n\nActor System\nThe BruteSystem actor handles various operations through dedicated handlers:\n\nThe reporter.start_report() method initiates a transaction for database operations, managing the process of storing and processing attack data.\nReporter System\nThe application uses a Reportable trait to standardize database interactions:\n\nImplementation example for the Individual model:\n\nThis creates a database entry with the specified values in a clean, maintainable pattern.\nOptimized IPInfo Integration\nTo minimize API usage, I implemented a caching system for IP data:\n\nCheck if the IP exists in the cache\nIf found and entry is less than 5 minutes old, use cached data\nIf not found or data is stale, fetch from the API\nStore results in cache\n\nThis approach significantly reduces API requests while maintaining data accuracy.\nConclusion\nThe successor is 100000% better than the predecessor, as it should be; the project has been running inside of a docker container for about three days now and has had no errors! So, I can safely say this project was well thought out\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-brute/","title":"Technical Breakdown: Brute"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-bruteexpose/":{"body":"Live Security Monitor\nProject inspired by Brute.Fail\nProject Overview\nLive Security Monitor (formerly BruteExpose) logs login attempts to OpenSSH servers. It captures:\n\nCredentials used\nOrigin (IP &amp; country)\nAttack protocol\nTimestamp\n\nTechnical Implementation\nLanguage Choice\nI chose Java because I wanted to add a Java project to my portfolio. In retrospect, C or C++ would have been more appropriate for this use case. Java familiarity from Minecraft plugin development made it a comfortable choice.\nMetrics &amp; Analytics System\nData Collection\nFor gathering metrics, I used IPInfo's .mmdb (MaxMind database). This required manual updates to prevent errors. The IPInfo API would have been a better choice.\nAnalytics Processing\nI implemented a modular analytics system where statistics can be easily added or removed. The system updates JSON files where metrics are tracked.\nCurrent analytics (as of 6/1/2024):\n\nNumberOfAttemptsOverTime\nAttackTotalByDayOfWeek\nDistributionOfAttackProtocols\nAttackOriginByCountry\nAttackOriginByIp\nCommonlyTargetedByCredential\n\nImplementing Custom Analytics\nHere's how to add your own analytics:\nProtocolBasedMetrics.java\nThis file populates values in the JSON file that tracks analytics. Related metrics are grouped into a single function:\n\nDistributionOfAttackProtocols.java\nThe actual stat tracking mechanism using a HashMap:\n\nBruteMetricData.java\nWhere analytics are instantiated:\n\nOpenSSH Modification\nDisabling Password Protection\nStandard OpenSSH includes a safety mechanism that prevents password leaking through timing attacks. When trying to dump passwords, you'll see:\n\nTo bypass this, remove the following line in the OpenSSH source code: https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/df56a8035d429b2184ee94aaa7e580c1ff67f73a/auth-pam.c#L1198\nCredential Logging\nTo capture credentials, we need a PAM module to dump them to a text file:\n\nPAM Module Integration\nAfter compiling the PAM module:\n\nPlace the .pam file in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/\nEdit common-auth: sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth\nAdd libbe_pam.so before the password denial:\n\n\nThis configuration makes the system check pam_unix.so first. If successful, it skips the next 2 lines. If not, it hits our module and then the denial module.\nLessons Learned\nWhat I would do differently:\n\n\nSkip the modular analytics system for a simpler hardcoded approach. The current approach adds complexity for a project that requires an OpenSSH vulnerability to function.\n\n\nUse C for the entire project rather than Java. Using two languages introduces unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nUse the IPInfo API instead of .mmdb files to avoid manual updates.\n\n\nReplace JSON with SQLite for better data handling. JSON has read limitations when file size grows, while SQLite handles both read and write operations efficiently.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-bruteexpose/","title":"Technical Breakdown: BruteExpose"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-vault/":{"body":"Modern Credential Manager\nI released my credential manager last month and am finally getting around to documenting it. This project represents a complete redesign of my previous work, featuring an authentication system and web-based architecture. I've maintained the use of AES symmetric encryption from my previous solution as it remains ideal for securely storing credentials.\nEvolution of the Project\nThe Predecessor: Desktop-Based Approach\nMy original credential manager was built as a terminal application in C# with .NET 7. While functional and cross-platform, it had inherent limitations:\n\nRequired executing an .exe file to run the application\nLimited portability despite cross-platform capabilities\nLess convenient access compared to web-based solutions\n\nThe core functionality was straightforward: users would create an AES key and credential store, then upload both to modify their stored credentials.\nThe Successor: Modern Web Architecture\nThe new implementation leverages a completely different technology stack:\n\nFrontend: Next.js with TypeScript\nBackend: Next.js API routes\nDatabase: MongoDB with Prisma ORM\nSecurity: AES encryption and iron-session for authentication\n\nThis technology selection was deliberate, creating a more accessible and maintainable solution while preserving strong security principles.\nTechnical Implementation\nDatabase Design\nRather than storing credentials in files, I chose MongoDB as a NoSQL database solution. This decision was driven by the need for flexibility rather than rigid structure—perfect for a credential manager where different credential types might require different data fields.\nHere's the Prisma schema defining the data models:\n\nEach vault contains:\n\nA unique identifier\nName and capacity limit\nEncrypted validation string (the \"secret\")\nInitialization vector (IV) for encryption\nRelationship to multiple credentials\n\nThe encryption strategy is selective—only the data field in the Credential model is encrypted. This approach maintains security for sensitive information while keeping metadata like credential type, name, and timestamps accessible for filtering and organization without requiring decryption.\nThe secret and iv fields in the Vault model serve a validation purpose. Rather than storing the actual encryption key, I encrypt a known string (\"secret\") and store the result. When a user provides their key, the system attempts to decrypt this validation string—if successful, the key is proven valid.\nAuthentication System\nThe application follows a \"one user, multiple vaults\" design philosophy. I intentionally hardcoded credentials in environment variables to prevent multiple user accounts, encouraging shared access with separate vaults for different purposes or users.\nSession management is handled through the iron-session library, which provides secure cookie-based authentication:\n\nThis implementation:\n\nRetrieves the encrypted cookie from the request\nVerifies the session's validity and expiration\nWorks alongside middleware to protect authenticated routes\n\nThis approach provides a defense-in-depth strategy—even if the authentication is compromised, attackers still need the correct AES key to access any vault data.\nEncryption Implementation\nI maintained AES as the encryption algorithm, using AES-CBC with 256-bit keys for industry-standard security:\n\nWhen a user creates a vault:\n\nThe system generates a cryptographically secure 256-bit key\nThis key encrypts a known validation string (\"secret\")\nThe encrypted validation string and IV are stored in the database\nThe actual encryption key is returned to the user for safekeeping\nThis key must be provided for future access to the vault\n\nThis approach ensures the encryption key never remains on the server, maintaining a zero-knowledge security model.\nKey Benefits of the New Design\n\nImproved Accessibility: Web-based interface accessible from any modern browser\nFlexible Data Structure: NoSQL database accommodates various credential types\nEnhanced Security: Maintains strong encryption while adding authentication layer\nBetter User Experience: More intuitive interface compared to terminal application\nSelective Encryption: Encrypts only sensitive data, improving performance and usability\n\nConclusion\nThis credential manager represents a significant improvement over its predecessor, transitioning from a terminal-based application to a modern web solution while preserving strong security principles. The combination of Next.js, MongoDB, Prisma, and proven encryption standards creates a secure yet accessible credential management system.\nThe \"one user, multiple vaults\" approach provides flexibility while maintaining simplicity in the authentication system. Each vault requires its own encryption key, ensuring compartmentalized security even when multiple users share the same login.\nWhile there are still opportunities for enhancement (such as refining the session expiration mechanism), the current implementation successfully balances security, usability, and modern web architecture.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-vault/","title":"Technical Breakdown: Vault"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cloudflare-zero-trust-docker-setup/":{"body":146,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/connect-docker-containers-to-nginx/":{"body":142,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-ark/":{"body":681,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-brute/":{"body":484,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-bruteexpose/":{"body":268,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/technical-breakdown-vault/":{"body":487,"title":3}},"length":8},"lang":"English"}
